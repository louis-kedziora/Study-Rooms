# Study Rooms Script

### Requirements
1. Need to be a student at Univeristy of Victoria or have a netlink account
2. An Amazon account which will act as a AWS account. This is not necessary as you could put it on any other type of server but I found this is to be the easiest service.

### Instructions
- Download the "study-rooms.py" file
- Modify these three lines replacing the '[]'s with your information
  * study_group_name.send_keys("[group]")
  * username.send_keys("[netlink username]")
  * password.send_keys("[netlink password]")
